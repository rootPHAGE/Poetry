You are not broken,
you are lost.
You are not "damaged goods",
you are just different.
Believe in yourself,
look for the light,
you will find it.
When you find what you need,
you will know who are,
you will know where you are going.
Maybe you will change,
but that's ok,
we all change.


This book in your hands,
was written by mine,
printed and mailed to you by another,
handed to you by another,
and is now held in yours,
being read by you.
You are the subject of this book,
you were not overlooked,
I wrote this for you.



I take in a lungful of smoke,
I exhale.
Each drag of the cigarette drags me closer to my grave.
And I'm glad.
The cigarette is my escape now.
A way of killing myself that somehow seems socially acceptable.
They think it's an addiction,
or maybe they think it's just to look cool.
I don't know,
I don't care.
All I know is that it's helping me escape.





Dryness.
Desert.
Parched.
No hope of any kind in sight.
Dragging my feet,
and kicking up dust.
I collapse.
The heat of the sun baking me like it's happily preparing a turkey dinner...
I've given up and will let this wasteland consume me.
Then I hear a faint "ding".
Over the dunes comes a trickle of water,
I look up, and see it.
I see hope,
flowing down the dunes is an ocean of sadness,
an ocean that it, too, thinks it's alone in the desert.
The water touches my cracked and dry lips.
I let the water drip into my mouth,
giving me hope.
The waves crash over me.
I'm no longer parched,
I'm no longer alone.
You are the ocean that thought it was dying in the vast desert.
You are no longer alone either.






You walked into my life.
I thought it was just going to be business-like,
You tell me your problems,
I give you some advice,
You follow it or don't,
and then disappear.
It wasn't.
It was like walking into the colosseum,
a roaring applause,
the encouragement from tens of thousands of people.
We were the main event that everyone came for.
And I'm glad I never missed a second of it.
